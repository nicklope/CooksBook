# CooksBook

## General

CooksBook is a web app I'm developing for my Unit 2 project @ General Assembly. My vision for the app is essentially a social site that focuses on restaurants and recipes where users can receive, post, edit and delete information and images. I want the app to have timeline of recipes / restaurant pics that expand when clicked on. The app will be made in MERN stack.

## MVP

- React front end user timeline
- The ability to post images and text that show up on timeline
- The ability to edit / delete posts
- Backend that stores and manages data

## Stretch Goals

- Search option
- Integrate recipe and restaurant API
- Option to search recipes by ingredients
- Option to search restaurnts by dishes
- Maybe add profile functionality

README.md is still in development and will move forward along with the app's development.
